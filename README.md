## &nbsp;Summary
This app was inspired by a monthly process that I used to manage my money in an excel spreadsheet. Personal finance has always been something of great interest to me so this was a perfect project for me to continue to build my programming skills. This was my first time working with a UI. Notable modules used are PySimpleGUI, SQLite, and Matplotlib.
